# Android to iPhone
### Thoughts on moving from an old Android phone to an iPhone 13 mini in 2022

But first...Of course, your millage my vary. It took me a long time to convince myself to get a new phone and pay the money for an iPhone. And calling this a comparison is probably wrong. I would expect the iPhone to be so much better. 

I was set on an iPhone mini primarily as no new Android phones were small enough.

#### Old Phone
* Moto g5s
* Android 8.1
* Â£229 in August 2017
* Paid approx Â£3 for a clear cover.

#### New Phone
* iPhone 13 mini (in green)
* iOS 15.5
* Â£629 in May 2022
* Paid Â£14.98 for a Ghostek COVERT case

#### Key initial reasons for upgrading
* 5G - its cool, but it's not going to change my life.
* Battery performance. I didn't trust the Moto to last over a day. 
* Security updates. The Moto hadn't had anything for circa two years. I value this stuff.
* Hardware performance (excluding the battery) - the Moto was getting slow and some apps (e.g. mobile banking) was getting super slow to load.  

#### Initial thoughts, two weeks in
* iOS has a hold on browsers on the platform. They all need to run the WebKit engine so really, browsers on iOS are all a version of Apple's safari browser. Because of that, certain browser features I was use to on Andriod are missing. Specifically, addons in FireFox for add blocking. Feels like the best option currently is to run safari and use FireFox Focus as an add/tracking blocker. However, there is a whole ecosystem of Safari apps that is brand new to me.
* There is no multi tab support in Firefox Focus.
* For my quite low usage, the battery lasts two days. And I trust it all the way to single figure % battery life.
* Not unique to iPhone, but its getting harder to easily turn off Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Location. I keep this all turned off if I'm not using it. I'd much prefer if the control centre/quick access buttons fully turned things off. 
* Lots of system utilities have location access by default. 
* I like the prompts to turn off tracking.
* My network provider doesn't offer Apple Visual Voicemail ðŸ˜’
* FaceID is great.
* Password manager integration is slick and easy to use. I use Bitwarden.
* The physical size of the phone is exactly what I wanted. We need more small smartphones.
* I've never been into taking many photos, but the camera is impressive. I didn't think I would care about this. 
* The _"switch to iPhone"_ process advertised by apple (you use an app to tranfer files and apps from Android) was...average at best. Quite a few things didn't move over so I spent easily two hours setting everything up the first time I turned it on. 
* I switched from Intra to the the CloudFlare 1.1.1.1 app for running more secure DNS. The VNP settings on the iPhone seem much slicker than what I was use to.
